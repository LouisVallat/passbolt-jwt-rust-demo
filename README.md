## Goal and content

This is a demonstration on how to use JWT login from a passbolt account kit,
such as the one you can export from the "Desktop App Setup" menu, at
`https://<your passbolt instance>/app/settings/desktop`. 

It has been developed during an internship in the summer of 2024 as a way to
make sure that I understood how the API worked as I was documenting it.
